Port of [Nomifactory](https://github.com/Nomifactory/Nomifactory) 1.3 to the [GregTech CE Unofficial](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech) generation of GT mods.

Progression and certain mods and CT scripts have been altered or removed due to the fixes native to GTCEu. For instance:
- Circuit progression has been largely converted to GTCEu native progression.
- Use GTCEu native materials over MorePlates, Avaritia, ContentTweaker etc. items, to take advantage of the material system and Material Tree
- Replace the Cryogenic Distillation with GTCEu native Liquid Airs distillation.
- Gregicality: Multiblocks for a smoother late-game.

Temporary: There is no RF -> EU conversion available in GTCEu yet. To alleviate this, the Large Lapidary Dynamo is added, available at MV.
Depending on feedback it may stay even after RF -> EU conversion is made available.
