[![Curseforge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_594351_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu)  
Port of [Nomifactory](https://github.com/Nomifactory/Nomifactory) 1.3 to the [GregTech CE Unofficial](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech) generation of GT mods, with updated quests, progression and minor balance changes to adapt to CEu's changes.
- Overhauled circuit progression closely following CEu stock 
- Multiblock versions of nearly all machines, including EBF, Freezer and DT, processing up to 256 recipes in parallel
- New processing chains for Naquadah, Advanced SMDs, Crystal Chips, and more
- Fixed lots of unpleasant CE-ness - no more stupid Amp system, different ore stone types don't clog up your inventory, etc.
- Super-performant emissive effects on machines, coil blocks, the Fusion Reactor, and more
- Updated questbook to guide you through all the new stuff
- lots more...   

## Hard mode info
If you want a harder, or perhaps a more "true" GregTech experience, check out the Expert mode. This pack mode is based on the [Self-Torture Edition fork](https://github.com/NotMyWing/Omnifactory-Self-Torture-Edition) of the original pack. Highlights include:

- No DML for easy infinite resources
- Omnicoins can't be spent
- The Steam Age
- No Creative Tank; instead...
- Stabilized Micro Miners for late-game infinite resources
- Harder recipes for assorted things like Vanadium, Graphene, Numismatic Dynamos, and more

Installation instructions:
- Install the hardmode config files from [here](https://github.com/tracer4b/nomi-ceu/tree/main/overrides). Restart the pack for this to take effect. 
  - Windows users may grab the utility [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracer4b/nomi-ceu/main/pack-mode-switcher.bat)(right click - save as), save it to the root directory of the pack (the same level as `\config`). 
- Run `/bq_admin default load ExpertQuests` to load the hard mode questbook.
