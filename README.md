Port of [Nomifactory](https://github.com/Nomifactory/Nomifactory) 1.3 to the [GregTech CE Unofficial](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech) generation of GT mods, with updated quests, progression and minor balance changes to adapt to CEu's changes.
- Overhauled circuit progression closely following CEu stock 
- Multiblock versions of nearly all machines, including EBF, Freezer and DT, processing up to 256 recipes in parallel
- New processing chains for Naquadah, Advanced SMDs, Crystal Chips, and more
- Fixed lots of unpleasant CE-ness - no more stupid Amp system, different ore stone types don't clog up your inventory, etc.
- Super-performant emissive effects on machines, coil blocks, the Fusion Reactor, and more
- Updated questbook to guide you through all the new stuff
- lots more...

Current project status: ðŸŸ§ 92% done. All scripts are ported and quests have been rewritten to fit CEu's new progression. There are still some bugs which need to be squashed, but you should be able to start playing now with few to no issues.
Any release will have to wait for the next CEu update, which will (hopefully) fully release Energy Converters and add new progression elements (Cleanroom).

Installation instructions for building the bleeding-edge version:
- Download the repository as a ZIP.
- Import it into your launcher of choice.
