Port of [Nomifactory](https://github.com/Nomifactory/Nomifactory) 1.3 to the [GregTech CE Unofficial](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech) generation of GT mods.

Progression and certain mods and CT scripts have been altered or removed due to the fixes and content native to GTCEu. For instance:
- Circuit progression has been largely converted to GTCEu native progression.
- Use GTCEu native materials over other mod material items, to take advantage of the material system and Material Tree
- Replace the Cryogenic Distillation with GTCEu native Liquid Airs distillation.
- Gregicality: Multiblocks for a smoother late-game.

Temporary: There is no RF -> EU conversion available in GTCEu yet. You have to make all EU energy with EU generators.
To alleviate this, the Large Lapidary Dynamo is added, available at MV and generating 614,400 EU per Diamond. Depending on feedback it may stay even after RF -> EU conversion is made available.

Installation instructions for building the bleeding-edge version:
- Download the repository as a ZIP.
- Import it into your launcher of choice.
