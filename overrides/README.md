# Hard mode config files
Config files for normal and hard modes are found in `\config-overrides\normal` and `\config-overrides\expert` respectively.

To install hard mode, drag the files inside `\config-overrides\expert` into the main `config` folder.

Windows users may also use `pack-mode-switcher.bat` found above.
