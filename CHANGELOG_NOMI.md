Apart from the changes listed in [the GTCEu Changelog](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech/blob/master/CHANGELOG-GTCEU.md), this is a list of all the changes nomi-ceu makes compared to Nomifactory.

# General
- Most materials from Thermal Expansion, Avaritia, Ender IO, NuclearCraft, and ContentTweaker have been replaced with equivalent GT material types and forms
- Plates are made in the Metal Bender (instead of Compressor). High-tier Compressor gating for heavy platings is removed
- Ore generation has been largely replaced with stock CEu ore generation. Highlights of this include:
  - Less dense, but more numerous ore veins
  - Chromite veins in the End
-
